== How to build

[NOTE]
====
Each time a build is run for either the kernel or bootloader, a JSON file is generated in the repo.
This JSON file is used to pass build info (like build triple, package name, bin name, etc.) which is used in later build processes.
====

=== basic build
kernel and bootloader
[source,bash]
```bash
make build
```

=== build the bootloader
[source,bash]
```bash
make build-crustlet
```

=== build the kernel
[source,bash]
```bash
make build-gazami
```

=== build a bootable disk image
This builds both the kernel and bootloader
[source,bash]
```bash
make create-img
```

=== build a bootable disk image, and boot from the disk image on qemu
This builds both the kernel and bootloader
[source,bash]
```bash
make run-qemu
```
